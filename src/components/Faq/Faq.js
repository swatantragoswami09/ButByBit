                    Spherium Finance in a nutshell is a Decentralised Finance
                    protocol that is working to solve the issue of
                    defragmentation in the industry by forging a sustainable and
                    scalable suite of applications in a cross-chain
                    interoperability environment. Spherium is creating an all
                    inclusive platform which will encapsulate mainstream and
                    revolutionary blockchains, enterprising projects and anyone
                    who wants to experience the power of finance in Web3.{" "}

                    Spherium aims to create an encapsulating cross-chain network
                    by integrating key L1 and L2 blockchains onto its protocol
                    line-up to enable the most comprehensive DeFi platform.
                    Spherium will start its cross-chain operations by
                    integrating major EVM blockchains, moving to the emerging
                    L2s. Furthermore, adding Non EVM blockchains will be the
                    next course of action to extend the reach and utility of
                    cross-chain operations. And finally, pushing up and coming
                    blockchains that set out to revolutionise the industry will
                    also have a distinguished place in the Spherium
                    infrastructure completing the whole circle of empowering the
                    cross-chain ecosystem.{" "}

                    multi suite applications to add cross-chain functionality

                    interacting with Spherium DApps, $SPHRI holds the most
