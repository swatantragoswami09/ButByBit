    "faqtitle": "What is HyperSwap?",
    "faqdescription": "HyperSwap is a completely decentralized cross-chain interoperable protocol for creating liquidity and swapping of ERC-20 and BEP20 tokens on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chains. HyperSwap eliminates the need for navigating through different platforms to simply swap tokens. It also eliminates the need for intermediaries. HyperSwap is easy to use, fast, efficient, secure and decentralized. Read more about HyperSwap <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>."

    "faqtitle": "How do I use Hyperswap?",
    "faqdescription": "To use HyperSwap, the first thing you need is a supported ERC20 and BEP20 tokens. If you have that ready, head over to the HyperSwap Mainnet and create a profile to start using the protocol to add liquidity and swap tokens."
  },
  {
    "count": "3",
    "faqtitle": "How does Hyperswap work?",
    "faqdescription": "Being an automated liquidity protocol, HyperSwap has template smart contracts that determines a standard way to make liquidity pools as well as corresponding compatible markets. Each pool is defined by a smart contract, as well as a few functions to enable swapping tokens, adding liquidity and more. To maintain the curve along which trades can happen, each pool uses the function x*y=k. The pool tracks liquidity reserves and updates it every single time a trade occurs. This automated balance feature enhances the trading of tokens on HyperSwap without requiring a counterparty on the other side. Read the HyperSwap documentation for an in-depth explanation."

    {
    "count": "4",
    "faqtitle": "How are prices determined?",
    "faqdescription": "The amount of each token in a pool determines the prices. Meanwhile, the smart contract maintains a constant using the following function: x*y=k. In this case x = token 0, y = token1, k = constant. A certain amount of one token is removed from the pool during a trade, as well as the amount of the other token. To maintain K, the balances held by the smart contract are adjusted during the execution of the trade, hence changing the price."

    "faqtitle": "A token was trading at X value, but I got a much lower trade value HyperSwap. Why?",
    "faqdescription": "Prices are aggregated from different sources on websites that show token prices, like <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/\" target=\"_blank\">etherscan.io</a> or <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">coinmarketcap.com.</a> These sources could be inaccurate when it comes to volumes, therefore it’s important to always check the exchange rate on HyperSwap before making a swap."

    "faqtitle": "How do I find a particular token?",
    "faqdescription": "If you have a difficult time finding a token in the default list, look for the token address using etherscan; copy and paste that address into the search field."

    "faqtitle": "I want to add tokens to HyperSwap, how can I do this?",
    "faqdescription": "Any ERC-20 and BEP20 tokens from the Ethereum and Binance ecosystems are compatible with HyperSwap. If you want your project to be searchable in HyperSwap’s interface, share a link to your token using query parameters. Once loaded via a link, the token will be added to the interface and will be available to trade. Another way is to contact the Spherium Finance team on admin@spherium.finance."

    "faqtitle": "I was charged for my transaction. Why?",
    "faqdescription": "For any trade that you make on HyperSwap, there will be a Gas fee levied, that carries the execution of trade. Read more about how Gas Fee works <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a>."

    "faqtitle": "I mistakenly transferred tokens directly to a pair contract, can I get them back?",
    "faqdescription": "There is no guarantee you can get them back. HyperSwap has no control over the token pair contracts’ functionality. As a result, any tokens accidentally transferred to the token contract itself are lost forever. We request all users to double check the address before transferring or swapping any token on the platform."

    "faqtitle": "I updated my token via a proxy contract, but the HyperSwap information page is showing the old details!",
    "faqdescription": "HyperSwaps information page reads the details of new tokens when they’re added to the subgraph. There may be some circumstances where an old symbol or name isn’t updated if the token was updated with a proxy contract. A guide to fixing this yourself is forthcoming. In the meantime, reach out to us with the details on our developer discord."

    "faqtitle": "What should I do when my swap fails?",
    "faqdescription": "The router is programmed to fail the transaction if a swap takes more than 20 minutes. This is to protect the users from extreme swings in prices that can occur while the transaction is pending. If this happens, your tokens will still be in your wallet, but the gas fees paid are not recoverable. To avoid this from happening, we recommend you use a high enough gas price to have your transaction mined in under 20 minutes. This usually falls under “Standard” or “Fast” in most gas price calculators."
