                            <h2>Proper Use</h2>
                            <p>PERSONAL USE. The Service is intended solely for the User’s personal use. The User is only allowed to use the Service for personal use, and may not create multiple accounts, including for the purpose of collusion and/or abuse of service.</p>
                            <p>EXPLOITS & BUGS. The Service is provided as is, and any exploitation of the Service or errors in program logic and/or code (bugs) constitutes a Prohibited Use and a material breach of this Agreement. Any funds the user may misappropriate in this manner pursuant to this clause shall be considered void and the immediate property of Spherium without limit.</p>
                            <p>JURISDICTIONS. Persons located in or residents of the United States, North Korea, Iran, Venezuela, Yemen, Syria or any other jurisdiction in which it is prohibited to use the types of services of the same kind as the Service provided by Spherium (the ”Prohibited Jurisdictions”) are not permitted to make use of the Service. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing restrictions on Service from Prohibited Jurisdictions apply equally to residents and citizens of other nations while located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction. Any attempt to circumvent the restrictions on usage by any persons located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction or Restricted Jurisdiction, is a breach of this Agreement.</p>
                            <p>Any and all monies (including cryptocurrencies) of a person located in a Prohibited Jurisdiction on the Service are VOID and can be confiscated or may be returned to the person at Spherium's sole discretion.</p>
                            <p>Spherium is a permissionless and fully decentralized platform for token sales, swaps as well as lending and borrowing of assets. We expressly prohibit and reject the use of the Service for any form of illicit activity, including money laundering, terrorist financing or trade sanctions violations, consistent with various jurisdictions’ laws, regulations and norms.</p>
                            <p>Although we make no warranty as to the merit, legality or juridical nature of any token (including whether or not it is considered a security or financial instrument under any applicable Securities Laws), we nonetheless understand the need of some token projects to require KYC/AML on their token sale participants. The use of KYC/AML tools on Spherium by entities using the Service is completely at the discretion of said entities. Therefore, and at the sole behest of fundraising entities and/or competent regulatory authorities, Spherium reserves the right, at any time, to ask for any KYC documentation it deems necessary to determine the identity and location of a User as well as to restrict service and payment until identity is sufficiently determined. Spherium further reserves the right to share submitted KYC information and documentation to 3rd parties to verify the authenticity of submitted information, and the end user (you) agree to this by using the Service.</p>
                            <p>Spherium also reserves the right to confiscate any and all funds that are found to be in violation of relevant and applicable anti-money laundering (AML) and countering terrorism financing (CFT) laws and regulations, and to cooperate with the competent authorities when and if necessary.</p>
